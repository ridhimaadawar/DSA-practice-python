# Leetcode Practice in Python 🐍

This repository contains my Python solutions for **LeetCode Data Structures & Algorithms problems**.
I'm using this space to build confidence, improve problem-solving skills, and stay consistent with my placement prep.

## 📚 Topics Covered

I'll be solving problems from the following topics:

* Arrays
* Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stack & Queue
* Recursion
* Searching & Sorting
* Trees
* Graphs

## 📁 Structure

Each category of difficulty has its folder. Inside each folder are Python files (`.py`) with LeetCode problem solutions.

## ✨ Goals

* Solve **3–5 LeetCode problems per week**
* Write **clean, readable, and efficient Python code**
* Track DSA progress alongside MCA preparation
