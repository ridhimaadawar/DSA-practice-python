# DSA Practice in Python 🐍

This repository contains my practice problems and solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms using Python.  
I'm using this space to build my confidence, improve problem-solving skills, and prepare for placements.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ✅ Arrays
- 🔜 Strings
- 🔜 Linked Lists
- 🔜 Stack & Queue
- 🔜 Recursion
- 🔜 Searching & Sorting
- 🔜 Trees
- 🔜 Graphs

## 📁 Structure

Each topic has its own folder. Inside each folder are Python files (`.py`) for individual problems.

Example:
/arrays/
max_in_list.py
reverse_list.py
sum_of_elements.py


## ✨ Goals

- Solve at least 3–5 problems per week
- Learn clean and readable coding practices
- Track DSA progress alongside MCA prep
